what the code is attempting to do?
- Concurrent execution of functions using goroutines and channels. 
- When the main function sends the function literal to the cnp channel, it can be picked up by any of the four goroutines and executed concurrently. 
- This allows for parallel processing of tasks, which can be useful in scenarios where you want to perform multiple tasks concurrently, such as handling incoming requests in a web server, processing data in parallel, or running independent tasks concurrently to improve performance.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Create a buffered channel with a capacity of 10
    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)

    // Start four goroutines 
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            // Continuously read and execute functions from the channel
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()
    }

    // Send a function to the channel
    cnp <- func() {
        fmt.Println("HERE1")
    }

    // Print "Hello" to the standard output
    fmt.Println("Hello")
}

Giving use-cases of what this construct/pattern could be used for?
- We can use the parrallel task pattern for webservers like processing data in paralle, execution of tasks execute
- Can use pipeline processing with channel.
